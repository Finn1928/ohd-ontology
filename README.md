# Background
We need a standardized approach that enables efficient access to information in Electronic Dental Records, and integration across different dental care providers and EHR systems. Our approach is to structure data from dental patient records using a realist approach. We interleave the construction of our Oral Health and Disease Ontology (OHD) with the re-encoding of the EDR data using the OHD, which more directly represents what happens during dental visits. The OHD includes terms relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of dental maladies, and is publicly available. Notably, we did not start from scratch. The OHD incorporates terms from a growing network of interoperable ontologies built using principles of the OBO Foundry. On this page we describe initial efforts to represent dental patient data contained in an EDR and to build the supporting OHD. This project includes a snapshot of the in-development ontology and sample queries that retrieve relevant data. Deidentified selections from patient records represented using the OHD are not yet publicly available. The papers below discuss the benefits and challenges of our approach as concerns meaningful use of EDRs aggregated across practices, practice software, and with other sources of health information such as the EHR.
